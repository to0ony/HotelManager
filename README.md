# HotelManager

The application serves as a hotel reservation 
management system, allowing users to view available 
rooms, make reservations, add additional services, 
review bills, and leave feedback.

Hotel administrators have access to a management 
dashboard where they can review all reservations, add 
or remove rooms, manage prices and discounts. 
The application also automatically generates invoices 
for each reservation.
